# Development-Economics1
This course is taught by [Dr. Mohammad Hosseini](https://m-hoseini.github.io/) in the second year of the master's program at the Tehran Institute for Advanced Studies [(TeIAS)](https://teias.institute/). There are two projects involved in this course: the first focuses on industrial policy in Iran, while the second investigates poverty and inequality in the country. Throughout these projects, we will analyze significant topics in development economics using public data. Below is a link to an atlas map of poverty and inequality in Iran, which provides various criteria at the provincial level and includes both rural and urban classifications.
